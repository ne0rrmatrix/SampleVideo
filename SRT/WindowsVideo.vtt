00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.200
- Now of course this isn't really about
- creating different content from different platforms.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200

- do if that is what you want

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.200
- But more importantly this allows you to
- really customize and optimize the video
- that your you delivering

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.200
- for platform, for form factor. That is all stuff that
